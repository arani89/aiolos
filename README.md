AIOLOS Middleware Framework
=========================

This framework uses Felix OSGi Container and a Cloud Environment (currently OpenStack) to develop distributed applications. The framework can be developed, deployed and run from inside an Eclipse with BNDTools. Currently only Linux and Mac OS X are supported because some UNIX commands are used for building. Windows is untested, but can be used by correctly configuring environment (not documented).

For more information on the AIOLOS framework, see the [AIOLOS overview](doc/aiolos.md).
